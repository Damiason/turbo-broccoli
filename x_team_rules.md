# X-Team 00 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
We will choose the tasks which interest us most. If there is disagreement or multiple people wanting same task, then team will vote or team leader will decide.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
For each task/week, e-mail each other with what we have completed and what we are working on the following week. Or setup a google Drive and mark each week's tasks and their status.


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
Ask questions to the team, either in person or on a team forum like "Slack". Team will consider of more people should be put on that task.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
Three days before deadline, everyone confirms whether they have completed their task. If not, team assists.
