# Our X-Team Rules

These rules will establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This will help us each understand the team's expectations,
and hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer hard feelings
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks



## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks



## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us



## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
